# Zip Code Finder - PHP

This is a challenge designed to test your ability to use PHP to fetch data from an API, and render it into a template.  [ZIP Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code) are used by the USPS as unique identifiers for geographic regions. [Zippopotomus](https://zippopotam.us) is a free API that accepts zip codes, and returns detailed information about the geographic region that zip code represents.


## The Challenge

1. Accept user input of a zip code via a form
2. Process the form submission and fetch location details about that zip code from the [Zippopotomus](https://zippopotam.us) API.
3. Display the location details.
4. Hit it with the pretty stick; personalize the composition with some tasteful visual flair.

## Requirements

- You must complete the challenge within 4 hours of receiving this link.
- You may use the included US State images in /states.
- You may not use 3rd-party libraries.
- The code should work in the latest version of Chrome.
- Don't worry about input validation, do what you can with HTML client-side validation (required, min/max, type, pattern, etc) but we're not expecting fancy error reporting. 

## Installation

- Feel free to use whatever PHP environment you like best ([MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/), [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com), etc).  Otherwise you can just run a [PHP server locally](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) like this:

```
$ cd /path/to/this/code-test
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.php` to load your code.


## Instructions
- Fork the branch 'php' of this repo to a private repo in your own GitHub account.
- Complete the challenge.
- Push your solution to your private repo.
- Share your repo with @thisanimus and @robmomary.
